# Preprocessing Features Validation Report
## 60Hz Curve Fitting Processor Enhancement

**Date:** January 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED AND WORKING

---

## Overview

This report documents the testing and validation of the new preprocessing features added to the 60Hz Curve Fitting Processor:
- `normalize_signals`: Normalize input signals to unit amplitude before fitting
- `remove_offset`: Remove DC offset from input signals before fitting

Both features have been implemented, thoroughly tested, and validated with real data.

---

## Implementation Summary

The preprocessing features were added to the `CurveFit60HzProcessor` class with the following key characteristics:

### Normalize Signals Feature
- **Purpose**: Normalize input signal amplitude to improve curve fitting for signals with very large or very small amplitudes
- **Implementation**: Scales signal to unit range before fitting, then scales fitted parameters back to original scale
- **Benefit**: Improves numerical stability and convergence for extreme amplitude signals

### Remove Offset Feature  
- **Purpose**: Remove DC offset from signals before fitting to improve parameter estimation
- **Implementation**: Subtracts mean value before fitting, then adds it back to the fitted offset parameter
- **Benefit**: Allows optimizer to focus on the AC component without being influenced by large DC offsets

### Combined Operation
Both features can be enabled simultaneously and work together:
1. DC offset is removed first
2. Signal is normalized second
3. Curve fitting is performed on preprocessed data
4. Parameters are scaled back to original signal scale
5. Final results match original signal characteristics
